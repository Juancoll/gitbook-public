# websockets

We use websocket as an Inter program or modul comunication protocol. I develop a custom prtocol over Websocket that implement this 2 Patterns 

* Request / Response Pattern
* Publish / Subscribe Pattern 

We can response to almost any problems in a efective way with a combination of this 2 patterns: 

* Syncronized calls
* Events 

I start developping the protocol to comunicate local Webs or \(mobile apps\) to a c\# Engine as the User Interface for Shine Product \([see more](shine.md)\).
