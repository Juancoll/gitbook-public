# websockets

We use websocket as an Inter program or module communication protocol. I develop a custom protocol over Websocket that implement this 2 Patterns 

* Request / Response Pattern
* Publish / Subscribe Pattern 

We can response to almost any problems in a effective way with a combination of this 2 patterns: 

* Synchronized calls
* Notifications by Events 

I start developing the protocol to communicate local Webs or \(mobile apps\) to a c\# Engine as the User Interface for Shine Product \([see more](shine.md)\).

* **nexjs - websocket** is used in frontend/Backend apps
* **nexcs - websocket** is used in local c\# application controlled by mobile, desktop or web applications.
