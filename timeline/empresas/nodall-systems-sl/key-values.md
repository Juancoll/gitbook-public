## For hoteliers

* **In order to use Shine, users must download the Hotel App**\*\* It is one of the most difficult issues hoteliers face today
* **A new communication channel** Communication with guests is intrusive, with Shine we created a new communication system in hotels that uses the standards the guests are used to in a daily basis: app and on-screen notifications. You will no longer need to knock on the door to communicate with your guests.
* **New use for the hotel rooms** Shine brings more possibilities to fill your rooms: invite guest for all multimedia related events such as futbol venues, cinema releases, even a live concert!
* **Identity & Innovation** A room with Shine is a Shine Room, bringing hotel rooms to a whole new level. Shine brings a real stand out concept, it is a game changer in how hotel rooms are seen today. Shine transforms the rooms almost literally with a very little intervention.
* **Open** Shine is a product adapted to the hoteliers needs, from the projection system \(cinema\) to a fully automated room \(domotics\)
* **Cost effective** It is a good solution for rooms that have no pleasent views or not views at all, noisy rooms or such that tend to be problematic for the hoteliers.
* **Redeemable** Cost 0 if you increment in 8 € / room
* **And, it is cheap** Innovation in hotels tends to be expensive and comes with a complicated deployment. Shine is affordable and designed as a plug & play concept.
